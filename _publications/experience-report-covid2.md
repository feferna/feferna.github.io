The COVID-19 pandemic introduced several changes in the work environment. The main change was the adoption of remote work by software development teams around the globe. This change was significant within the mobile software development field because of its dependency on physical devices to perform tests. Therefore, some companies adopted remote access tools to address this issue, where developers can handle devices online through a server. In this sense, the present work surveyed 62 developers at SIDIA R&D Institute, located in Manaus, Brazil, regarding the usefulness of mobile access tools. The results show that the tools are helpful (62% of employees found them very helpful), even though some developers still prefer to use the physical devices while working from the office. However, the tool promoted collaboration between developers, where users would frequently add new devices to be accessed by others remotely. Thus, although remote access tools cannot replace physical devices, mobile software developers consider them a welcome addition.
