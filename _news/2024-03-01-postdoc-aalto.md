I’ve officially started as a **Postdoctoral Researcher** at **Aalto University**, working within the [Finnish Center for Artificial Intelligence (FCAI)](https://fcai.fi/). My position is hosted by the **Computational Behavior Lab**, where I’ll be conducting research at the intersection of **machine learning**, **human–computer interaction**, and **cognitive modeling**.

In this role, I aim to explore how interactive and human-aligned AI systems can be designed to better support real-world decision-making, particularly through methods such as **reinforcement learning**, **preference modeling**, and **simulation-based optimization**.

I’m excited to collaborate with interdisciplinary teams and contribute to FCAI’s mission of creating AI that is trustworthy, understandable, and beneficial to society.
