Excited to share that I was awarded a **full Ph.D. scholarship** from the **Brazilian government** (CNPq) to pursue my doctoral studies in **Artificial Intelligence** at **Oklahoma State University (OSU)** in the United States.

This opportunity will allow me to conduct research in areas such as **robotics**, **reinforcement learning**, **evolutionary computation**, and **neural architecture search**, while also engaging with an international research community.

The scholarship covers the full duration of my Ph.D. and represents a major step in my academic journey in terms of scientific training and global collaboration.
