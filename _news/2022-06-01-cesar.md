I am happy to share that I joined **CESAR** as a **Senior Data Scientist**, contributing to applied research and development projects at the intersection of **Generative AI**, **machine learning**, and **software engineering**.

At CESAR, I will be developing a framework for automatically generating business reports using **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques. Iâ€™ll also explore how **Generative AI**, including **Chain-of-Thought prompting**, can enhance developer productivity.

I will also be working in collaboration with **Dell Inc.** to  **ML and optimization models** for **resource allocation in cluster servers**, alongside anomaly detection systems using tools like **MongoDB**, **Grafana**, **Prometheus**, and **Scikit-Learn**.

This is an incredible opportunity to merge cutting-edge AI with real-world engineering challenges in production systems.
