I’m excited to share that I started working as an **Artificial Intelligence Specialist** at **Sidia Instituto de Ciência e Tecnologia**, in Manaus (Brazil), contributing to cutting-edge research and development in **Machine Learning**, **Computer Vision**, and **Deep Learning**.

In this role, I’m leading a team of five data scientists on projects that apply AI techniques to real-world challenges across several domains, including **face and gender recognition**, and **recommender systems**. We’re leveraging tools like **TensorFlow**, **PyTorch**, **OpenCV**, and collaborating closely with engineering teams on Samsung initiatives.

This work not only pushes the boundaries of applied AI but also involves producing **technical reports** and **scientific publications** to share our findings with the broader research and developer communities.
