I’m excited to share that I started a **Postdoctoral Researcher** position at the **University of São Paulo (USP), São Carlos campus**, working on a project that combines **Artificial Intelligence** and **Computer Vision** for urban flood detection.

In this role, I’m developing a real-time system that uses footage from ordinary surveillance cameras to detect **flash flooding** events in São Carlos (Brazil). The project integrates **deep learning**, **semantic segmentation**, **AutoML**, and **IoT** technologies to support city-wide climate resilience.

This research is funded by **FAPESP** and will contribute to **two international journal publications**, helping bridge academic research with real-world environmental challenges.
