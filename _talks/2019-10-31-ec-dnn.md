This was my second guest lecture for the *ECEN5773 - Intelligent Systems* course at Oklahoma State University. I introduced undergraduate students to the use of **Evolutionary Computation (EC)** for designing and optimizing Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), highlighting two major contributions from my own research.

### Topics covered:

- Challenges in manual DNN architecture design and pruning
- EC-based approaches for architecture search:
  - **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)** for automatic CNN design (psoCNN)
  - **Evolution Strategy (ES)** for filter pruning in CNNs, ResNets, and DenseNets (DeepPruningES)
- Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) for selecting models based on performance-complexity trade-offs
- Implementation and experimentation on datasets like CIFAR-10

### Instructor:
Prof. Gary G. Yen, Regents Professor, OSU
