I am a postdoctoral researcher at Aalto University, working at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence, Human-Computer Interaction, and Cognitive Science. My research is conducted within the Computational Behavior Lab and supported by the Finnish Center for Artificial Intelligence (FCAI). I focus on building adaptive agents using neural architecture search and reinforcement learning methods that align with human goals and behavior.

My academic background spans three continents, having studied and worked in Brazil, the United States, and Finland. I earned my Ph.D. from Oklahoma State University (USA), my M.Sc. from the University of Campinas (UNICAMP – Brazil), and my undergraduate degree from the Federal Institute of Science and Technology of Ceará (IFCE – Brazil).

Previously, I held a postdoctoral position at the University of São Paulo (USP – Brazil), where I worked on real-time flood detection systems using computer vision and deep learning. I also bring experience from applied research roles in industry, including SIDIA and CESAR, where I led projects involving generative AI, anomaly detection, and the optimization of machine learning pipelines.

I am particularly interested in the design of intelligent systems that are interpretable, human-aligned, and capable of learning from interaction. My current efforts explore how reinforcement learning and programmatic reasoning can be combined to enhance agent behavior in complex decision environments.
